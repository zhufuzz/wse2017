The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It 
extends from the 
<A href="Arctic.html">Arctic Ocean</A> in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, 
depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by 
Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.
