# WebSearchEngine
I implement a NYU course search system. The crawler can crawl all the course information between 2010-2017 from GSAS CS department.
One can search a course form either introduction keyword or the professor's name.

## Install
pip install -r requirements

## Run
python run.py
then use a browser to access "http://your-IP:5000/" and hope you can enjoy it. ^ ^

## Introduction
Here is my first assignment for Web Search Engine. I didn't use anyone's code in the back-end part of the assignment include the HTML parser and the crawler, 
and I can prove it with my github commit log. As for the front-end part, I made a simple copy of Google, which is the reason I take this course. 
I should apology that I didn't follow professor's advice that put all my code in the same direcotry, since that I'm learning to organize my code 
in a more Pythonic way. I really appreciate all the guidance and criticism you give to me. Thanks a lot!

Note: I'm sure that my crawler obey the robots.txt rule

Please contact me for any questions and bugs.
